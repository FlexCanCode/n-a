    <h3>This is what we call attributes,and depending on your attributes it you get a archetype for example "High flyer" "3pt Hunter" or "Midrange Deadeye"
      . These are examples of specailized archetypes that excel in one or two things. This would be your build.</h3>

    <h3> When you finish your build go out and have fun!!As you can see my build is very efficent and went a perfect 6/6 on the court and 3/3 from 3pt and i never play serious my only rule to you is NEVER TAKE THE GAME SERIOUS.</h3>
